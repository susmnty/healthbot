- HDL: 45 mg/dL (Low)
- LDL: 150 mg/dL (Elevated)
- Triglycerides: 180 mg/dL (Elevated)

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:

Electrocardiogram (ECG):
- Sinus rhythm at 88 bpm
- ST-segment depression in leads II, III, aVF, V4-V6
- T-wave inversions in leads V1-V3
- QRS duration: 0.08 seconds
- QT interval: 0.44 seconds

Chest X-Ray:
- Normal cardiac silhouette
- Clear lung fields
- No evidence of pulmonary edema
- No pneumothorax or pleural effusion

Echocardiogram:
- Left ventricular ejection fraction: 55%
- Mild left ventricular hypertrophy
- No regional wall motion abnormalities
- Normal valvular function
- No pericardial effusion

IMPRESSION:
1. Acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers
2. ST-segment depression suggestive of myocardial ischemia
3. Multiple cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, family history)
4. Elevated blood glucose requiring better control

DIAGNOSIS:
- Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
- Hypertension, uncontrolled
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled
- Hyperlipidemia

TREATMENT PLAN:
1. Immediate:
   - Admit to cardiac care unit
   - Continuous cardiac monitoring
   - Oxygen therapy as needed
   - Aspirin 325mg loading dose, then 81mg daily
   - Clopidogrel 300mg loading dose, then 75mg daily
   - Metoprolol 25mg twice daily
   - Atorvastatin 40mg daily
   - Nitroglycerin for chest pain

2. Medical Management:
   - Strict blood pressure control (target <130/80)
   - Tight glycemic control (target HbA1c <7%)
   - Aggressive lipid management (target LDL <70)
   - Smoking cessation counseling
   - Cardiac rehabilitation program

3. Follow-up:
   - Cardiology consultation within 24 hours
   - Stress test or cardiac catheterization as indicated
   - Primary care follow-up in 1 week
   - Repeat cardiac biomarkers in 6-8 hours

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Cardiac catheterization within 24-48 hours
2. Lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise
3. Medication compliance education
4. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and glucose
5. Annual cardiac evaluation

PROGNOSIS:
Guarded. Patient has multiple cardiovascular risk factors and requires aggressive risk factor modification. With appropriate medical therapy and lifestyle changes, prognosis can be improved.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
- Take all medications as prescribed
- Follow up with cardiologist in 1 week
- Return to emergency department if chest pain returns
- Maintain low-sodium, low-fat diet
- Exercise as tolerated
- Monitor blood pressure daily
